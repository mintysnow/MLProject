# Aimes Iowa House Prices
### Advanced Regression Techniques - Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting

- The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 
- The Dataset includes information regarding 2,580 homes and 82 variables. The variables consist of information regarding the home like number of bathrooms, roof style, and square footage.

## Goal of This Project 
Clean the dataset and build and select a machine learning model that will best predict the sales price of the home.

## Models Used
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. SVR
